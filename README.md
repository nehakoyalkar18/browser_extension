## 🔍 Objective
As part of my Cyber Security Internship, this task was to learn how to:
- Review installed browser extensions
- Identify potentially harmful or unnecessary ones
- Remove them to enhance browser security and performance

## 🛠 Steps Performed

1. **Opened Chrome Extensions Manager**
   - Used `chrome://extensions/` in the Chrome address bar.

2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions**
   - Found the following extensions:
     - ✅ Google Docs Offline (official, trusted)
     - ✅ McAfee WebAdvisor (security tool, kept)
     - ⚠️ WPS PDF - PDF tools (disabled, used cautiously)
     - ❌ 360 Internet Protection (unknown trust, decided to remove)

3. **Removed / Disabled Suspicious or Unneeded Extensions**
   - Removed `360 Internet Protection` due to mixed reviews and privacy concerns.
   - Disabled `WPS PDF` to reduce unnecessary extension load.

4. **Restarted Browser**
   - Ensured changes took effect.

5. **Documented Process**
   - Took before and after screenshots to show cleanup.

6. **Added before ad after screenshots**
    
## 📝 What I Learned

- Always check permissions: extensions that can “Read and change all your data” on websites can be risky.
- Remove extensions you don’t actively use to minimize attack surface.
- Stick to official stores and well-reviewed extensions.

## 🔐 Key Browser Security Points

- **Install extensions only from trusted sources.**
- **Regularly audit extensions** to see if you still need them.
- Be cautious with extensions that:
  - Access all site data
  - Read clipboard or password fields
  - Run on all tabs automatically
